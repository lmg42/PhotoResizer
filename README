README

Created in VS2010, developed in C#.

This application allows the user to resize photographs and generate thumbnails specifically for web use. HTML code is also generated for each file.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Enter the source and destination folders
2. Enter the file name and alternate text
3. Enter the requested size of the large sized image and thumbnail image
4. Push 'GO'

WHAT HAPPENS

The files from the source folder are used to generate smaller web-friendly files (a larger one and a thumbnail) in the destination directory and named with the provided file name. HTML code is generated from the newly generated files. By clicking in the text box, the code can be copied.
